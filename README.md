# Frontend for finale Project
This app has been generated using `create-react-app`,
Add components in the `src` folder and use them in `src/app.js` to get started.

## Programs for project
This is connected to a backend API created by me Eva Sjöholm, using MongoDB with a deployed link using Render. For the frontend I used Vanilla JSX, React and CSS. Working with the fetch-method and useState for bringing my own easy yet effective Quiz that i can continue building on, with a very calm and pretty webpage that is to aim towards building similar projects for me and my friends company Wörkout Sverige AB.
