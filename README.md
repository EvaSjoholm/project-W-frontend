## Programs for project
This is connected to a backend API created by me with a deployed link. For the frontend I used Vanilla JSX, React and CSS. I worked with useState, useEffect and Navigate to get my backend Quiz-data. My aim was to have a very calm and pretty yet simple design to it which I managed. This is a project I can continue working on to create a future Wörkouter-App for my current fitness company. 

I am very proud of creating this on my own and seeing where my knowledge is after 6 months of Technigo Bootcamp. It was a real challenge and now I see clearly how far I have come and what journey I have ahead, as well as how I would rather work in teams in future than solo projects as I believe in team work and effort.
