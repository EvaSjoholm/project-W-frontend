## Programs for project
This is connected to a backend API created by me with a deployed link. For the frontend I used Vanilla JSX, React and CSS. Working with the fetch-method and useState for bringing my own easy yet effective Quiz that i can continue building on, with a very calm and pretty design to it. My idea to aim this project into a future app for my company.
